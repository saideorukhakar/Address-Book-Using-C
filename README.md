#Address Book Using C

A console-based Address Book Management System developed in C, designed to efficiently manage personal and professional contacts. This project demonstrates the use of structures, file handling, functions, modular design, and data validation to build a fully functional and user-friendly contact management application.


* Features

1. Create Contacts: Add new contacts with Name, Phone Number, and Email
2. Search Contacts: Search by Name, Phone Number, or Email
3. Edit Contacts: Update existing contact details
